When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When we want to collaborate on one project with many deveopers or when
	developing multiple features of the same project parrallely.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When multiple people are working on the same project we want to import only
	those commits which doesn't affect our current functionality we are working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are needed when we want to copy someone's repository on github into
	our own repository on git hub. Clones are used when copying repository 
	from local to local or from github to local. Branch is used when we want 
	to seperately develop some features without affecting the the main functionality.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    I think because we can make changes locally when we know we are not going
	to have internet connection for some time.
